    "### Using Markov Chains to Simulate English\n",
    "One of the original applications of Markov chains was to study natural languages, meaning spoken\n",
    "or written languages like English or Russian [VHL06]. In the early 20th century, Markov used his\n",
    "chains to model how Russian switched from vowels to consonants. By mid-century, they had been\n",
    "used as an attempt to model English. It turns out that plain Markov chains are, by themselves,\n",
    "insufficient to model or produce very good English. However, they can approach a fairly good model\n",
    "of bad English, with sometimes amusing results.\n",
    "61\n",
    "\n",
    "By nature, a Markov chain is only concerned with its current state, not with previous states.\n",
    "A Markov chain simulating transitions between English words is therefore completely unaware of\n",
    "context or even of previous words in a sentence. For example, if a chain’s current state is the word\n",
    "“continuous,” the chain may say that the next word in a sentence is more likely to be “function”\n",
    "rather than “raccoon.” However the phrase “continuous function” may be gibberish in the context of\n",
    "the rest of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Random Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the problem of generating English sentences that are similar to the text contained in a\n",
    "specific file, called the training set. The goal is to construct a Markov chain whose states and\n",
    "transition probabilities represent the vocabulary and — hopefully — the style of the source material.\n",
    "There are several ways to approach this problem, but one simple strategy is to assign each unique\n",
    "word in the training set to a state, then construct the transition probabilities between the states\n",
    "based on the ordering of the words in the training set. To indicate the beginning and end of a\n",
    "sentence requires two extra states: a start state, start, marking the beginning of a sentence; and a\n",
    "stop state, stop, marking the end. The start state should only transitions to words that appear at\n",
    "the beginning of a sentence in the training set, and only words that appear at the end a sentence in\n",
    "the training set should transition to the stop state."

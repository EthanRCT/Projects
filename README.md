<!-- Labs -->
## Labs

Each folder contains a Jypiter notebook containing the code and results for each project. Here is a list of the projects and their descriptions:

### <a href="https://github.com/EthanRCT/Projects/tree/main/Wavelets">Wavelets</a>

- Objective: Wavelets are used to sparsely represent information. This makes them useful in
a variety of applications. I explore both the one and two-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms
using various types of wavelets. I then use a Python package called PyWavelets for further wavelet
analysis including image cleaning and image compression.

### <a href="https://github.com/EthanRCT/Projects/tree/main/Facial%20Recognition">Facial Recognition</a>

- Objective: Facial recognition algorithms attempt to match a person’s portrait to a database
of many portraits. Facial recognition is becoming increasingly important in security, law enforcement,
artificial intelligence, and other areas. Though humans can easily match pictures to people, computers
are beginning to surpass humans at facial recognition. In this project, I implement a basic facial
recognition system that relies on eigenvectors and the SVD to efficiently determine the difference
between faces.

### <a href="https://github.com/EthanRCT/Projects/tree/main/Markov%20Chains">Markov Chains</a>

- Objective: A Markov chain is a collection of states with specified probabilities for transitioning from one state to another. They are characterized by the fact that the future behavior of the system depends only on its current state. In this project I learn to construct, analyze, and interact with
Markov chains, then use a Markov-based approach to simulate natural language.


### <a href="https://github.com/EthanRCT/Projects/blob/main/Fourier%20Transform%20%26%20Convolution">Fourier Transform & Convolution</a>

- Objective: The analysis of periodic functions has many applications in pure and applied
mathematics, especially in settings dealing with sound waves. The Fourier transform provides a way
to analyze such periodic functions. In this lab, I work with digital audio signals
in Python, implement the discrete Fourier transform, and use the Fourier transform to detect the
frequencies present in a given sound wave.

- Objective: The Fourier transform reveals information in the frequency domain about signals
and images that might not be apparent in the usual time (sound) or spatial (image) domain. In this
project, I use the discrete Fourier transform to efficiently convolve sound signals and filter out some
types of unwanted noise from both sounds and images.

##### *Downloand this project to listen to the audio files*

### <a href="https://github.com/EthanRCT/Projects/tree/main/OneDimmOptimization">One Dimensional Optimization</a>

- Objective: Most mathematical optimization problems involve estimating the minimizer(s) of
a scalar-valued function. Many algorithms for optimizing functions with a high-dimensional domain
depend on routines for optimizing functions of a single variable. There are many techniques for
optimization in one dimension, each with varying degrees of precision and speed. In this project, I
implement the golden section search method, Newton’s method, and the secant method, then apply
them to the backtracking problem.

### <a href="https://github.com/EthanRCT/Projects/tree/main/OneDimmOptimization">Cancer Prediction</a>
- Objective: Create a pytorch radiologist using a U-Net DNN. In the notebook, I include a method of calculating accuracy and images that show the dense prediction produced by the network on an image the network has never seen before.
